<h2 style="font-family:georgia" >Official schedule for Relay for Life</h2>
<p style="font-family:georgia" > For 20 years, Relay For Life has been the Canadian Cancer Society’s signature fundraising event. At your Relay, you’ll see participants of all ages taking turns walking around a designated track. Our events are 6 to 12 hours in length, depending on the location. We ask each team to have at least one member on the track at all times, as a way to symbolize our solidarity with those affected by cancer across the country. With nearly 1 in 2 Canadians expected to be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, we all know someone whose life has been changed by this disease.
On and off track, there’s always something to do at Relay For Life. Those taking a break from walking can check out their event’s entertainment and activities, or relax at their team’s campsite. Wherever your Relay takes place, you’ll be joining thousands of people across the country who have shown up for their communities — and helped us prove that together, we are bigger than cancer.</p>
